How to use:

At the time of writing this is the intended build process:

```
./configure --target-list=mips64-softmmu
patch -p1 < host.patch
make -j`nproc`
```

I make no guarantees beyond what the initial paper did for this.

My only goal here was to fix the problems with the original repo which I feel I have done

TODO:
Add a Dockerfile with a tagged version of debian that this can build in
Add scuba build support
