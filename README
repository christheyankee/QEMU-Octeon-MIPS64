How to use:

At the time of writing this is the intended build process:

```
./configure --target-list=mips64-softmmu
patch -p1 < host.patch
make -j`nproc`
```

I make no guarantees beyond what the initial paper did for this.

The paper while impressive produced unusable artifacts for a variety of reasons.

As a result I set out to fix the problems with the original repo.

I feel I have done that and produced a repeatable and stable build system.

TODO:
Add a Dockerfile with a tagged version of debian that this can build in
Add scuba build support
Fix the paper's linux patch as well
